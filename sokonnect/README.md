## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- MySQL installed and running

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash

    npm install
    ```

4. Configure environment variables:
    - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following:
      ```bash
      DB_HOST=your_db_host
      DB_USER=your_db_user
      DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
      DB_NAME=your_db_name
      JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
      ```

5. Run the backend server:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm start
    ```

6. Run the frontend server:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm run dev

## API Endpoints
### Authentication
- **POST /api/auth/login:** Authenticate user and return JWT token.
- **POST /api/auth/logout:** Logout user and invalidate JWT token.

### Employees
- **GET /api/employees:** Retrieve a list of employees.
- **POST /api/employees:** Add a new employee.
- **PUT /api/employees/:id:** Update an existing employee.
- **DELETE /api/employees/:id:** Delete an employee.

### Categories

- **POST /api/categories:** Create a new category.
- **PUT /api/categories/:id:** Update an existing category.
- **DELETE /api/categories/:id:** Delete a category.

## Architecture
The system employs a three-tier architecture:
1. **Presentation Layer (Web Client):**
    - Built with React.js
    - Handles user interactions and displays data
    - Communicates with the API layer using Axios

2. **API Layer (Web Server):**
    - Developed with Node.js and Express.js
    - Exposes API endpoints for CRUD operations
    - Validates and sanitizes user input
    - Interacts with the data layer using MySQL

3. **Data Layer (Database):**
    - Uses MySQL to store data
    - Ensures data integrity and consistency

## Challenges Overcome
- **Database Integration:** Ensuring seamless connectivity and data integrity.
- **Secure Authentication:** Implementing robust JWT-based authentication.
- **Form Validation:** Creating intuitive and error-free user input forms.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Differentiating access levels for admins and employees.
